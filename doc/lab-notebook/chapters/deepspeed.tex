\section{DeepSpeed Introduction}
DeepSpeed is a distributed machine learning framework that enables training to
scale to massive numbers of paramters efficiently.
It's main focus is on reducing the memory bottleneck caused by redundant
memory in Deep Neural Network training where each worker has a full
copy of all the data required to train the network.
DeepSpeed takes advantage of the fact that this data can be partitioned
among the workers and can therefore run with much lower memory overheads
and fit much larger models without resorting to techniques like
model-parallelism~\cite{corr/abs-1909-08053, nips/2018/shazeer} or
pipeline-parallelism~\cite{nips/2019/huang, sosp/2019/narayanan}.

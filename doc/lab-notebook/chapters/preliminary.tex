Initially we want to match one of the papers and use ResNet-32 with the CIFAR-10
dataset.

It appears transient servers and spot instances are more expensive now.
In 2016 they were 70\% cheaper with Google, and 90\% cheaper with Amazon than
dedicated servers.

Add in \href{https://github.com/google-research/bert}{BERT} models.

\section{Synthetic Scalability Tests}
For these tests, I ran the standard Horovod synthetic benchmakr tests for
the ResNet50 model.
This benchmark runs on a synthetic image dataset to measure the throughput in
images per second given a particular configuration.
I ran two separate versions of the scalability experiments, a \texttt{Clustered}
version in which multiple GPUs are collocated on a single instance (such as a
p3.8xlarge) and a \texttt{Spread} version in which each instance had a single GPU and
were spread across multiple Availability Zones.
Each test used the p3 instance type which are equipped with V100 GPUs.

\subsection{Experimental Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The obvious (and expected) takeaway is that the clustered throughput
        scaled significantly better.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{Clustered} Avg Scaling Factor: 90\%
        \item \texttt{Spread} Avg Scaling Factor: 50\%
    \end{itemize}
    \item Need to consider tradeoff of higher availability vs lower throughput
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If we have a single machine with many GPUs, we get better perf
            but getting preempted means losing all work
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

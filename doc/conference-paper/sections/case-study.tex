\section{Case Study}
\label{sec:case-study}

Originally we were inspired by the lack of inlining occuring in the JVM when
running Spark SQL applications.
We found call sites in the program go through phases.
\todo{All}{Which one should we use as our example?}
We modified the JVM to output inline decisions consistent with our database,
in order to easily check the behavior of inlining call sites.
